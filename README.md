# 6-2 Important Terms that I noticed

Dissecting the example code and writing it in ways that I can understand

- `Function`: Used to define parameters or numbers together into one another. A more specific example, add two numbers together using parameters.
ex: `Function addNumbers(num1, num2)`
- camelCase is essential for VSCode, just like any other coding language. The way I typed the term should demonstrate what code inputs should look like.

- `return` is what returns me the result of a function so that I may be able to put it to use.

> `return num1 + num2`/

Defining a function alone isn't enough. I have to call the numbers and write arguments to activate the function and put these parameters to work.
`addNumbers (0, 20)`

After returning the results, I need to assign these results to a variable, that way the numbers I just added don't disappear into the night, lost numbers left behind.

ex. from video:
> `const sum= addNumbers (5, 10) `

And now, actually printing the code to see final results.

 `console.log ("The sum is:", sum)`
